                Hello everyone, my name is Rui. I worked as an accounting assistant for over 3 years and I decided to learn and break into a new field - Interactive Media Design! 
                I’m taking this program to acquire professional academic knowledge and essential employability skills to plant the seeds for my future career - <abbr title="User Interface User Experience">UIUX</abbr> designer. 
                Meanwhile, I’m looking to develop my network by meeting new people who are also interested in interactive media design and will possibly be or are already in this field. 
                </p>

                <p>
                 My favourite quote is <q>There is no passion to be found in setting for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.</q>  - <cite>Nelson Mandela</cite> 
                This quote inspired me to make the decision to start over in a new field.
                </p>

                <p>
                One thing that I’m passionate about is <em>travelling</em>. In other words, exploring different cities! 
                On August 26<sup>th</sup>, a couple days before school started, I went to downtown and explored the ByWard Market, and I got a traditional poncho there, which is very unique and exotic to me! 
                I also had some BeaverTails which was so good with a cup of coffee, and enjoyed some live music which performed right in front of the ByWard Cafe. It was a fun day!
                </p>
